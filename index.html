          <p>Pass the Pigs is a dice game a player repeatedly rolls a Pig until either a 1 is rolled or the plater decides to "hold".</p>
          <p>Rules:</p>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
            <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
